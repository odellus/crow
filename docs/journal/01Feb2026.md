Rabbit rabbit! I am starting my day working on my journal. I foolishly put most of my thoughts I had just now in yesterday's journal because I don't really know what all was changed.

Which means the problem is persistence. I'm supposed to be the persistent memory but too many things are happening.

Pretty sure we got streaming and some of the `tool call not found` errors fixed in the frontend but yeah. I am going to end up using a lot more of the crow_ide than I thought, so I need to figure out a way to integrate that with my plans for how to do this with vscode extensions, which seem to be the way to go because with [`code-server`](https://github.com/coder/code-server.git) I can use my browser as a testbed for my vs code extension/theme I'm working on.

So things I need to do:

1. Understand how to build a proper ACP agent with [`agent-client-protocol`](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/python-sdk.git) by going through the tutorials by hand
2. [`OpenHands-SDK`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk.git) is open source and I am working on a fork of it but I can totally try to make it either
    - completely my own and never be able to sync upstream
    - play nice and make all my changes configurable  
I lean more towards the latter
3. Because my crow_ide seems to be in a more advanced state than the [`vscode-acp`](https://github.com/omercnet/vscode-acp.git), I'm guessing I'm going to give it its own repo to live in because yeah not sure about how to do that? I want it to be a separate part of the code tbh, but yeah I guess I just need to get to work on that real quick. It's a part of the testing environment and yeah probably going to re-use a lot of the elements for my mono-extension and theme to build [trae solo](https://trae.com/solo)
